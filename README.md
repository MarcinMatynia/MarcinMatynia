# Hello, I am Marcin ðŸ‘‹

### About Me

My journey in the programming world began many years ago when I became fascinated by the powerful possibilities that the
Java language brings along. Since that moment, it has remained a constant axis in my career, and each day is a new
opportunity to delve even deeper into its potential.

Professionally, I primarily utilize the Spring framework in creating scalable and efficient applications. I make use of
various Spring modules such as Spring Boot, Spring MVC, and Spring Data to fully harness the capabilities provided by
this versatile framework.

In my toolkit, you'll also find tools like Hibernate, which I employ for effective database management. When combined
with PostgreSQL technology, I create robust and reliable data storage systems. When implementing changes in databases, I
rely on Liquibase to ensure a smooth and controlled migration process.

Additionally, I eagerly embrace opportunities to play the role of a DevOps engineer, where I have the chance to work
with Kubernetes. Working within this ecosystem, I regularly utilize Vault and ArgoCD to ensure secure data management
and automated application deployment.

I'm constantly committed to improving my skills, and I regularly enhance my expertise by familiarizing myself with new
technologies. On this profile, I publish my solutions, showcasing the process of learning about new tools and solutions.

If you'd like to learn more about my work, experience, or how collaboration with me could bring value to your team, I
warmly invite you to get in touch. Together, we can create innovative, efficient, and reliable solutions that will meet
even the most demanding expectations.
